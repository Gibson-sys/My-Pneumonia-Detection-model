# Pneumonia Detection Model

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It uses machine learning to classify images into "Normal" or "Pneumonia" categories.

## Features
- Detects pneumonia with high accuracy using chest X-rays.
- Implements transfer learning with models like VGG19.
- Provides visualization of predictions and confusion matriceS
